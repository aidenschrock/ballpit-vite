# R3F + React + Vite

This template is a quick starter for my React Three Fiber projects, adding to the standard React Vite Template.
This provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules, as well as some of my commonly used R3F components.
I've also defined the config to allow for glb assets.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
